# Need to implement a dependency injection container
# The container should be a way to pass dependencies into handlers at runtime
# The dependency needs to be able to pass events to the message bus upon successful execution
# The dependency needs to be able to depend on other dependencies
# The dependency needs to be able to be mocked for testing
# The dependency needs to be able to be a singleton
# The dependency needs to be able to be a factory
